### The "Template Repository" Action Plan

Here is the professional workflow for turning your Hello World project into a reusable template:

**Step 1: Prepare the "Hello World" Repo to be a Template**

1.  **Generalize Names:** Go through your `README.md`, `deploy.yml`, and other files. Replace hardcoded names like `hello-world-writer` and `hello-world-app` with placeholder variables like `<YOUR_FUNCTION_NAME>` and `<YOUR_APP_NAME>`.
2.  **Clean the Code:** Remove any logic from `main.py` that is specific to the "Hello World" task, leaving only the robust framework (OCI client setup, logging, FastAPI structure, workarounds, etc.).
3.  **Create a Setup Script (Optional but Recommended):** Create a simple script like `setup.sh` that prompts the user for the new function name and automatically performs a find-and-replace on the placeholder variables throughout the project.

**Step 2: Make it an Official GitHub Template**

1.  Go to your Hello World repository on GitHub.
2.  Click **Settings**.
3.  Check the box labeled **"Template repository"**.

That's it. The repository is now a template.

**Step 3: Create Your New RAG Project from the Template**

1.  Navigate to the main page of your newly configured template repository.
2.  Click the green **"Use this template"** button.
3.  Select **"Create a new repository"**.
4.  Give your new repository its name (e.g., `rag-ingestor-v2`).

You will now have a brand new repository that is a perfect copy of your template, but with no shared history. It is a completely independent project.

**Step 4: The New Project Checklist**

After creating the new repository from the template, you have a clear, repeatable checklist:

1.  Clone the new repository locally.
2.  (If you made a setup script) Run `./setup.sh` to customize the names.
3.  Add your new application-specific logic to `main.py`.
4.  In OCI, create the new, dedicated IAM user and group (e.g., `rag-ingestor-service-user`, `RAG-Ingestor-Executors`).
5.  Create the required OCI resources (the function application, bucket, etc.).
6.  Generate a new API key for the new user.
7.  Go to your new GitHub repository's settings and populate the Actions secrets with the **new user's credentials**.
8.  Push your first commit to `main`. The CI/CD pipeline will run and correctly **create** your new function from scratch.

This "template" approach is the ideal way to leverage your success. It makes creating new, robust, and secure functions a fast, repeatable, and low-risk process.
